## Features

### Login System and High Score Storage System
  This game implements a **database** system which stores the **login details with the high score of the player**. 
  This gives us an advantage of storing the highest score of any certain player at any point of time.
  The GUI is developed using tkinter.
  
  The database lets you check if the user is already registered, if the entered password by the user is incorrect and lets you retrieve the highest score of any player. The database is based on Python's default database i.e Sqlite3 and SQL queries are used to perform certain operations.
